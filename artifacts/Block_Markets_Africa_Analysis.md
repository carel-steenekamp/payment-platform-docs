## Technical Architecture

### Network Characteristics

**Consensus Mechanism**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based  
**Throughput**: 1000+ TPS (transactions per second)  
**Settlement**: Instant and asynchronous  
**Compatibility**: Fully EVM compatible  
**Network Type**: Public Permissioned  

**Key Features**:

**Permissioning**: Tokens require Smart KYC NFTs to transact - ensures only KYC'd wallets can hold/trade regulated tokens.

---

## Competitive Positioning

### vs Traditional Payment Networks

**Advantages**:
- Lower cost (no card network fees)
- Instant settlement (vs T+1 or T+2)
- Micro-transactions enabled
- Programmable money (smart contracts)
- Direct peer-to-peer (no intermediaries)

**Challenges**:
- Network effects (smaller user base)
- Merchant acceptance
- Consumer education

---

### vs Public Blockchains (Ethereum, etc.)

**Advantages**:
- Regulatory compliance built-in
- FSP-operated validators (not anonymous miners)
- KYC enforcement at transaction level
- African regulatory acceptance

**Challenges**:
- Less decentralized (permissioned)
- Smaller developer ecosystem
- Limited to regulated participants

---

### vs Private Enterprise Blockchains

**Advantages**:
- Interoperability between FSPs (not siloed)
- Public permissioned (accessible but regulated)
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Industry collaboration

**Challenges**:
- Requires FSP participation/consensus
- Governance complexity

---

## Strategic Themes

### 1. "Open" Philosophy

**Meaning**: Infrastructure collaboratively operated by industry, not controlled by single entity.

**Contrast**: Traditional payment networks (Visa/Mastercard) or private blockchains (single bank).

**Business Strategy**: Positioning as neutral infrastructure provider, not competitor to FSPs.

---

### 2. Regulatory-First Approach

**Strategy**: Build compliance into infrastructure, not add it later.

**Evidence**:
- FSP-only validators
- Mandatory KYC via Smart NFTs
- FSCA compliance
- SARB collaboration

**Differentiation**: Other blockchain projects add compliance as afterthought; BMA makes it foundational.

---

### 3. Enabling Small/Medium FSPs

**Mission**: "Leveling the playing field for all"

**Problem Addressed**: Small FSPs cannot afford to build advanced payment/tokenization infrastructure independently.

**Solution**: Shared infrastructure model where small FSPs access same capabilities as large banks.

**Business Impact**: Larger addressable market (not just big banks), faster adoption (lower barriers), network effects from multiple FSPs.

---

### 4. Real-World Asset Focus

**Strategy**: Beyond cryptocurrency to tokenize traditional assets (securities, property, commodities).

**Use Cases**:
- Fractional real estate ownership
- Tokenized bonds with daily yield distribution
- Supply chain financing with automated collateral
- Loyalty points as tradeable assets

**Business Opportunity**: Massive asset classes (real estate, securities) vs cryptocurrency market.

---
